# Customer Lifetime Value
Customer lifetime value (CLV or CLTV) is a metric that represents the total net profit a company can expect to generate from a customer throughout their entire relationship. It takes into account the customerâ€™s initial purchase, repeat purchases, and the average duration of their relationship with the company. [1]
